- We can check this example here for JWT verification if the current solution doesn't work https://github.com/jfbilodeau/jwks-client/blob/master/src/keyset.rs


UNFORTYNATELY, we cannot verify the proof on-chain. Our pulbic signals have a size of 246 * 32 = 7,872 bytes. The limit of tx on Solana is 1,232. We could theoretically just send multiple transaction like when we deploy program but that makes our solution in practical. If we have to send so many transaction to simply execute a proof verification then it's super slow.
